# ESP Arduino Readme

***THE config.mk FILE MUST REMAIN AND STAY IN THIS DIRECTORY. THIS FILE LINKS THE ARDUINO LIBRARIES TO THE PROJECT. ***

If you are using VS Code, you can edit c_cpp_properties.json to your own content and link to libaries in order to avoid IDE conflicts.

The following Arduino Libraries are required:
- Adafruit GFX
- Adafruit SSD1306
- More pending
